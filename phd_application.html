					<h4>Available PhD Positions</h4>
					Currently, I have some available PhD positions for the 2022-2023 intake. Students interested in 
					doing a PhD in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML&amp;AI) under my supervision please send me applications via email.
				</div>
				
				<div class="sect-lv4">
					<h4>Research Topics</h4>
					
					<p>
						Below, I list some of my broad research topics which I expect prospective students 
						will work on under my supervision. If you are interested in these topics or 
						have any other research proposals, don't hesitate to contact me and we 
						can discuss further &#128516;. 
					</p>
					
					<ul class="ul-topics">
						<li><span class="topic-title">Label and Data Efficient Deep Learning</span></li>
					
						<li><span class="topic-title">Robust and Generalizable Artificial Intelligence</span></li>
						
						<li><span class="topic-title">Representation Learning and Generative Models</span></li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						When working on these topics, students may need to use machine learning techniques 
						such as self-supervised learning, generative models, adversarial learning, 
						variational inference, causal inference, and distillation. Therefore, 
						it will be a plus if prospective students have good theoretical knowledge about and/or 
						practical experience with these techniques.
					</p>
					
				</div>
				
				<div class="sect-lv4">
					<h4>Required Documents</h4>
					
					<p>
						When you contact me, please send me the following documents via email:
					</p>
					
					<ul class="required-docs">
						<li>A comprehensive resume (CV)</li>
						<li>Theses</li>
						<li>Academic transcripts</li>
						<li>Published papers and scientific reports in English (if any)</li>
						<li>Recommendation letters from your previous teachers/supervisors/seniors (if any)</li>
						<li>A globally accepted English language certificate (e.g., IELTS, TOEFL, PTE)</li>
						<li>
							A research proposal specifying at least three reseach problems you aim to 
							address during your PhD and your general solutions to these problems
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						Please note that the above documents must be written in or translated to English. My list of documents 
						may not be exhaustive and you are encouraged to include other documents you think could demonstrate 
						your research capability.<!-- The research proposal is <i>important</i> and should be prepared carefully 
						since it will make you stand out from other candidates.-->
					</p>

					<h4>Selection Criteria</h4>
					
					<ul class="phd-select-criteria">
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Research inclination</span>: Students should be intrigued by understanding 
							why and how things work in a <i>deep and generalizable</i> way, and creating <i>novel and better</i> methods to solve 
							their problems rather than just reimplementing existing models naively.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Research experience</span>: Publishing high-quality papers in top-tier ML&amp;AI 
							conferences and journals requires many advanced research skills such as choosing problems, forming and validating ideas, 
							conducting experiments, writing papers, ... which take lots of time to master. Therefore, students with 
							relevant reserach experience are preferred to those without. In addition, students should have their mind 
							well-prepared for possible difficulties of doing PhD since in reality, things could be very different from what they have thought.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Academic achievements</span>: Academic achievements are recognitions of students' efforts
							and abilities to attain some challenging targets during previous studies, which, to a certain extent, 
							could suggest how well the students will perform when doing PhD. Therefore, students with significant academic achievements 
							tend to be more favored than others.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Good mathematical background</span>: Math is important for high-quality research in ML&amp;AI 
							as it stands behind most advances in the field. Some branches of math commonly used in ML&amp;AI research include 
							statistics, optimization, algebra, and calculus. It will be advantageous if students had high GPAs for math courses 
							and can demonstrate their deep knowledge about these branches of math during interview.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Good programming skills</span>: While deep mathematical knowledge enables 
							students to design correct methods, good programming skills enable students to implement their methods 
							effectively and efficiently, hence, will increase their productivity. One important programming skill is
							the ability to code in an organized and reusable way so that the students and possibly other people could 
							inherit and develop new methods from their old code bases. For this criterion, students who experienced 
							working as a main programmer in academic or industrial projects will be valued more.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Competent English</span>: The <i>minimum</i> level for competent English is 
							the Academic IELTS overall score of at least 6.5 with no individual component scores less than 6.0. 
							For more details about this requirement and equivalent scores for other kinds of English test 
							such as PTE Academic or TOEFL iBT, please refer to the table in Part C, Section 5 from this 
							<a href="https://policy.deakin.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=161&_ga=2.99201430.985662063.1661985856-1319013805.1627035190#major4" target="_blank">link</a>. 
							Please note that a student could be interviewed without meeting this requirement, but 
							this requirement is <i>compulsory</i> for the student to be granted a PhD scholarship.
