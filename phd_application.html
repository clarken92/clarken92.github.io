					<h4>Available PhD Positions</h4>
					Currently, I have 1-2 available PhD positions for this year (2022) and next year (2023).
				</div>
				
				<div class="sect-lv4">
					<h4>Research Topics</h4>
					
					<p>
						Below I list some of my broad research topics which I expect prospective students 
						will work on under my supervision. If you are interested in these topics or 
						have any other research proposals, don't hesitate to contact me and we 
						can discuss further &#128516;. 
					</p>
					
					<ul class="ul-topics">
						<li><span class="topic-title">Label and Data Efficient Deep Learning</span></li>
					
						<li><span class="topic-title">Responsible and Robust AI</span></li>
						
						<li><span class="topic-title">Representation Learning</span></li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						When working on these topics, students may need to use machine learning techniques 
						such as self-supervised learning, generative models, adversarial learning, 
						variational inference, causal inference, disentanglement. Therefore, it will be a plus 
						if prospective students have good theoretical knowledge about and/or 
						practical experience with these techniques.
					</p>
					
				</div>
				
				<div class="sect-lv4">
					<h4>Documents to be sent</h4>
					
					<p>
						When you contact me, please send me the following documents via email:
					</p>
					
					<ul class="required-docs">
						<li>A comprehensive resume (CV)</li>
						<li>Theses</li>
						<li>Academic transcripts</li>
						<li>Published papers and scientific reports in English (if any)</li>
						<li>A research proposal specifying at least three reseach problems/challenges you aim to address during your PhD</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						The last one (research proposal) is <i>important</i> and should be prepared carefully. 
						A good research proposal will make the candidate stand out from others.
					</p>

					<h4>Selection Criteria</h4>
					
					<ul class="phd-select-criteria">
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Research inclination</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Research experience</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Academic recognition</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Good mathematical background</span>: Maths is important for high-quality research in ML &amp; AI 
							as it stands behind most advances in the field. Some branches of maths commonly used in ML &amp; AI research include 
							statistics, optimization, algebra, calculus. It would be a great advantage if students could demonstrate their 
							deep understanding of these topic during interview.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Good programming skills</span>: While a good mathematical background enables 
							students to design correct methods, good programming skills enable students to implement their methods 
							effectively and efficiently, which increases their productivity.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Competent English</span>: The <i>minimum</i> level for competent English is 
							the Academic IELTS overall score of at least 6.5 with no individual component scores less than 6.0. 
							For more details about this requirement and equivalent scores for other kinds of English test 
							such as PTE Academic or TOEFL, please refer to the table in Part C, Section 5 from this 
							<a href="https://policy.deakin.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=161&_ga=2.99201430.985662063.1661985856-1319013805.1627035190#major4">link</a>. 
							Please note that a student could be interviewed without meeting this requirement, but 
							this requirement is <i>compulsory</i> for the student to be granted a PhD scholarship.
