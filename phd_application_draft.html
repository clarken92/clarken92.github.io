					<h4>Research Topics</h4>
					
					<p>
						Below I list some of my broad research topics which I expect prospective students 
						will work on under my supervision. If you are interested in these topics or 
						have any other research proposals, don't hesitate to contact me and we 
						can discuss further &#128516;. 
					</p>
					
					<ul class="ul-topics">
						<li><span class="topic-title">Label and Data Efficient Deep Learning</span></li>
					
						<li><span class="topic-title">Responsible and Robust AI</span></li>
						
						<li><span class="topic-title">Representation Learning</span></li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						When working on these topics, students may need to use machine learning techniques 
						such as self-supervised learning, generative models, adversarial learning, 
						variational inference, causal inference, disentanglement. Therefore, it will be a plus 
						if prospective students have good theoretical knowledge about and/or 
						practical experience with these techniques.
					</p>

				<div class="sect-lv4">
					<h4>Documents to be sent</h4>
					
					<p>
						When you contact me, please send me the following documents via email:
					</p>
					
					<ul class="required-docs">
						<li>A comprehensive resume (CV)</li>
						<li>Theses</li>
						<li>Academic transcripts</li>
						<li>Published papers and scientific reports in English (if any)</li>
						<li>A globally accepted English language certificate (e.g., IELTS, TOEFL, PTE)</li>
						<li>A research proposal specifying at least three reseach problems/challenges you aim to address during your PhD</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						The last one (research proposal) is <i>important</i> and should be prepared carefully. 
						A good research proposal will make the candidate stand out from others.
						Some students may feel reluctant to write a research proposal because it seems hard and boring but 
						they may not be aware that their upcoming PhD could be ten times harder and more boring than the research proposal they've just written.
						So I hope you would take it easily but not lightly as a small challenge to yourself to see whether you are suitable for research or not.

					<h4>Selection Criteria</h4>
					
					<p>
						Once you have contacted me via email with your application, I may .  After contact me . 
						If you are a promising candidate, you will be invited to an official interview  with 
						an academic panel including senior researchers in A2I2 
						
						research interest, experience, and targets. 
						From these I may find whether you are suitable for doing PhD with me.
					</p>
					
					<ul class="phd-select-criteria">
						<li>
							Thirst of conquering the unknowns and willing to pursue a research career. 
							PhD is just a stepping stone, and a by-product of the learning process.

							research experience... To master these skills require a lot of time and practice. 
							Students are expected to have some research experience in advance (e.g., being the first author of 1-2 papers)
							The best is that you can see your path ahead is not easy.  
							
														
							A PhD program in Australia is quite short, 
							usually takes 3 to 4 years to complete. During this time, students need to

						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="select-criterion">Good programming skills</span>: While a good mathematical background enables 
							students to design correct methods, good programming skills enable students to implement their methods 
							effectively and efficiently, which increases their productivity.

								Keep learning but know how to exploiting
