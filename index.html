					<h4>About me</h4>
					
					<p>
						I am Kien Do (aka Đỗ Đức Kiên). I studied Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours Program) 
						at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Vietnam National University Hanoi (VNU Hanoi) 
						from 2010 to 2014 and graduated with high distinction. In 2016, I received a 
						Deakin University Postgraduate Research Scholarship (DUPRS) and started my PhD at
						the <a href="https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/">Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute</a> (A2I2) 
						(previously known as the Centre for Pattern Recognition and Data Analytics (PRaDA)) at 
						Deakin University, Australia under the supervision of 
						Dr. <a href="https://truyentran.github.io/">Truyen Tran</a> and 
						Prof. <a href="https://svethav.github.io/">Svetha Venkatesh</a>. 
						I completed my PhD in early 2020 and have been working as a 
						Postdoctoral Research Fellow at A2I2. My research interests 
						include Generative Models, Representation Learning, 
						Adversarial Learning, and Causal Inference.
